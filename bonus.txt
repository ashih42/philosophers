- Supports input number of philosophers!

- Wonderful UML state diagram!

- You can choose health-text OR health-bar, so many options!

- Have console log, SDL2 visualizer, and sounds!  What a rich multi-media experience!

- Such high quality variety textures!

- Randomized sprites in each session!

- Emergent scheduling: Every other philosopher takes opposite turns in eating/thinking alternately!
